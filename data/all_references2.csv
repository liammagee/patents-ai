Qiao  Visualization: In Figure 11, we scatter plot the convolutional ﬁlters gw(x, y, z) learned in the ﬁrst layer of SpiderCNN and the color of a point represents the value of gw at the point.  Fig. 12. Visualization for the convolutional ﬁlters learned in in the ﬁrst layer of Spi- derCNN. The 3D ﬁlters are shown as scatter plots projected on to the planes x = 0 or y = 0 or z = 0.  In Figure 12 we choose a plane passing through the origin, and project the points that lie on one side of the plane of the scatter graph onto the plane. We see some similar patterns that appear in 2D image ﬁlters. The visualization gives some hints about the geometric features that the convolutional ﬁlters in SpiderCNN learn. For example, the ﬁrst row in Figure 12 corresponds to 2D image ﬁlters that can capture boundary information.  6 Conclusions  A new convolutional neural network SpiderCNN that can directly process 3D point clouds with parameterized convolutional ﬁlters is proposed. More complex network architectures and more applications of SpiderCNN can be explored.

SpiderCNN  15  7.1 Taylor v.s. MLP  Recall that the ﬁlter used in SpiderCNN decomposes as  g(x, y, z) = gStep(x, y, z) · gT aylor(x, y, z).  We study empirically the eﬀect of replacing gT aylor with MLP in a 4-layer Spider- CNN for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40. The results are summarized in Table 4. We see that Taylor outperformances MLP with more parameters.  Table 4. Taylor vs. MLP for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40  Methods  MLP(10, 5, 3) MLP(6, 5, 3) MLP(5, 3, 3) order-3 Taylor  Accuracy(%)  91.6  91.1  91.4  92.4  7.2 Number of parameters in Taylor  Recall that gT aylor is chosen to be order-3 expansion in SpiderCNN, and the trilinear interpolation gives us a simpler expansion:  fwT = wT  0 + wT  1 x + wT  2 y + wT  3 z + wT  4 xy + wT  5 yz + wT  6 xz + wT  16xyz.  We study the eﬀect of replacing gT aylor with fwT , order-2 Taylor and linear Taylor in 4-layer SpiderCNN for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40. The results are summarized in Table 5.  Table 5.

Method  order-3 Taylor order-2 Taylor  linear Taylor fwT  Accuracy(%)  92.4  91.9  91.6  91.9  One justiﬁcation for using oder-3 Taylor instead of fwT is that if we compose fwT with a rigid transformation R3, terms like x2y will appear. For instance, under the transformation x(cid:48) = x + y, the expression x(cid:48)2 becomes x2 + 2xy + y2.  16  Y. Xu, T. Fan, M. Xu, L. Zeng and Y.
