In order to quantitatively evaluate the quality of our generated images, we compute the Inception score for the downsampled version (256 × 256) of our generated images (See Table 2). The Inception score of the generated images using P-GANs is very close to the that of the original images, presented in Figure 5.  multiple chained generators and discriminators. The input of each stage of the chain is the output of the previous stage. One of the major differences between StackGAN-v2 and StackGAN-v1 is that these stages are trained jointly, whereas in StackGAN-v1, they are trained independently. In our experiments, we found that the method by which we encode the textual descriptions can indeed have a big impact on the quality of the generated images. Here, we discuss the text embedding that we applied. Text embedding: Both StackGAN-v1 and StackGAN-v2 condition the image generation process on ϕt , i.e. the text embedding of the corresponding image description generated from a pretrained char-CNN-RNN encoder (Reed et al., 2016)",./refs/download/Fashion-gen: The generative fashion dataset and challenge.pdf,

Le 1  Abstract  EfficientNet-B7  84  To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Source code is at https: //github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/ master/models/official/efficientnet.  1. Introduction Scaling up ConvNets is widely used to achieve better accuracy.
