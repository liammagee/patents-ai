Scott 5.6 Ablation Study We perform ablation studies on In-Shop Clothes and CUB-200-2011, as reported in Table 4. First, directly applying hard negative sampling (HNS) to the whole training set is diﬃcult to obtain a performance gain. Actually, our baseline model applies a semi-HNS, which outperforms HNS. We design a strong class-level constrain - Anchor-Neighbor Sampling of HTL, which encourages the model to learn discriminative features from visual similar classes. This is the key to per- formance boost. Second, we integrated the proposed anchor-neighbor sampling and dynamic violate margin into HDC where a contrastive loss is used. As shown in Table 4 (bottom), HDC+ got an improvement of 7.3% R@1 on the In-Shop Clothes Retrieval, suggesting that our methods work practically well with a con- trastive loss and HDC. Third, HTL with a depth of 16 achieves best performance at R@1 of 80.9%. This is used as default setting in all our experiments. We also include results of “ﬂat” tree with depth=1. Results suggest that the “ﬂat” tree with the proposed dynamic violate margin improves the R@1 from 75.3% to 78.9%, and hierarchy tree improves it further to 80.9%. Table 4.

HTL eﬀectively handles the main limitation of random sampling, which is a critical issue for deep metric learning. First, we construct a hierarchical tree at the class level which encodes global context information over the whole dataset. Visual similar classes are merged recursively to form the hierarchy. Second, the problem of triplet collection is formulated by proposing a new violate margin, which is computed dynamically based on the designed hierarchical tree. This allows it to learn from more meaningful hard samples with the guide of global context. The proposed HTL is evaluated on the Deep Metric Learning with Hierarchical Triplet Loss 15 tasks of image retrieval and face recognition, where it achieves new state-of-the- art performance on a number of standard benchmarks. 16 W.
