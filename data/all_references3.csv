Qiao  Visualization: In Figure 11, we scatter plot the convolutional ﬁlters gw(x, y, z) learned in the ﬁrst layer of SpiderCNN and the color of a point represents the value of gw at the point.  Fig. 12. Visualization for the convolutional ﬁlters learned in in the ﬁrst layer of SpiderCNN. The 3D ﬁlters are shown as scatter plots projected on to the planes x = 0 or y = 0 or z = 0.  In Figure 12 we choose a plane passing through the origin, and project the points that lie on one side of the plane of the scatter graph onto the plane. We see some similar patterns that appear in 2D image ﬁlters. The visualization gives some hints about the geometric features that the convolutional ﬁlters in SpiderCNN learn. For example, the ﬁrst row in Figure 12 corresponds to 2D image ﬁlters that can capture boundary information.  6 Conclusions  A new convolutional neural network SpiderCNN that can directly process 3D point clouds with parameterized convolutional ﬁlters is proposed. More complex network architectures and more applications of SpiderCNN can be explored.

SpiderCNN  15  7.1 Taylor v.s. MLP  Recall that the ﬁlter used in SpiderCNN decomposes as  g(x, y, z) = gStep(x, y, z) · gT aylor(x, y, z).  We study empirically the eﬀect of replacing gT aylor with MLP in a 4-layer SpiderCNN for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40. The results are summarized in Table 4. We see that Taylor outperformances MLP with more parameters.  Table 4. Taylor vs. MLP for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40  Methods  MLP(10, 5, 3) MLP(6, 5, 3) MLP(5, 3, 3) order-3 Taylor  Accuracy(%)  91.6  91.1  91.4  92.4  7.2 Number of parameters in Taylor  Recall that gT aylor is chosen to be order-3 expansion in SpiderCNN, and the trilinear interpolation gives us a simpler expansion:  fwT = wT  0 + wT  1 x + wT  2 y + wT  3 z + wT  4 xy + wT  5 yz + wT  6 xz + wT  16xyz.  We study the eﬀect of replacing gT aylor with fwT , order-2 Taylor and linear Taylor in 4-layer SpiderCNN for classiﬁcation on ModelNet40. The results are summarized in Table 5.  Table 5. The eﬀect of number of parameters used in Taylor expansions on ModelNet40 classiﬁcation accuracy.  Method  order-3 Taylor order-2 Taylor  linear Taylor fwT  Accuracy(%)  92.4  91.9  91.6  91.9  One justiﬁcation for using oder-3 Taylor instead of fwT is that if we compose fwT with a rigid transformation R3, terms like x2y will appear. For instance, under the transformation x(cid:48) = x + y, the expression x(cid:48)2 becomes x2 + 2xy + y2.  16  Y. Xu, T. Fan, M. Xu, L. Zeng and Y.

Interaction contexts (in gray) synthesized for two central objects (in orange) with networks trained with the indicated number of epochs.  Fig. 15. Gallery of interaction context generation results. We show two selected central objects from each category (in orange), and the scenes generated by our network iGEN-NET around the objects (in gray). Note how the scenes generated for each pair of objects are quite distinct and adapt to the geometry of the objects, e.g., drying racks and cups.  scene to a query object, assigning the label of the scene to the object. (iii) We use a direct neural network classifier that uses exactly the same network architecture as the Eobj subnetwork in (i), but is not trained together with the Escn subnetwork.  In a cross-validation experiment with a 9:1 train to test ratio over 25 object categories, we observe that the direct network, i.e., alternative (iii), obtains an accuracy of 84%, the nearest neighbor approach, i.e., alternative (ii), obtains 92%, and the fSIM-NET extended with a classifier, i.e., alternative (i), performs slightly better at 94%. Thus, the use of our network provides results that are around 10% higher than when using a direct classifier, with a slight improvement when attaching a classifier to the network.  Interaction context generation network. To train the generation network, we use 90% of the scenes and their central objects in our dataset as training data, along with their labels, and test on the remaining 10%. Note that a single category label is assigned to each scene, e.g., desk, table, bed, etc.  We present results of using our iGEN-NET to synthesize interaction contexts, and analyze how the network adapts to different types of input. Figure 14 illustrates the learning progress of the generative network, where we show the synthesis results for a same testing shape obtained with networks at different training stages. We observe that after 120 epochs of training, the network is able to synthesize interaction contexts effectively, where the scenes contain a rich variety of details and meaningful object shapes, such as the human sitting on the bench or objects on top of the table.

The various interaction labels are shown in different colors, while the central objects are colored orange.  Figure 20 shows a gallery of segmented interaction contexts obtained with our iSEG-NET. In addition, Figure 16 shows the results on scenes generated for objects with multiple functionality. We observe in all of these examples that the network is able to segment objects into groups that have similar interactions with the central object, and identify the correct labels for the groups. For example, the scene for a desk is segmented into the chair besides the desk, the floor which supports the desk, and one group for all the objects that are supported by the desk. In general, the segmentations include between one to five different groups of objects. To provide a quantitative evaluation of the iSEG-NET, we compute the segmentation accuracy of the network in a cross-validation experiment, finding that the average accuracy for a segmentation obtained by applying a hard maximum to the label probabilities is 98%.  Scene refinement. Figure 21 shows examples of refining the synthesized scenes by replacing sets of voxels with higher-resolution models retrieved from a dataset of objects. We observe how the segmentation into interaction types allows the post-processing to select meaningful objects to compose the scenes, and place them in appropriate positions and orientations.  8 DISCUSSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this work, we enable functional understanding and functionality hallucination of isolated 3D objects with the introduction of three deep neural networks: fSIM-NET, iGEN-NET, and iSEG-NET. Specifically, the networks allow not only to predict the functionality of an object, but also to substantiate it by generating an example scene that demonstrates how the object interacts with surrounding objects to reveal a functional usage scenario.  We show in our evaluation that fSIM-NET outperforms handcrafted descriptors and models for functionality prediction proposed in previous works. In addition, the scenes exemplifying functional uses of objects generated by our iGEN-NET incorporate both humanobject and object-object interactions, and adapt to the geometry of the objects. Finally, the iSEG-NET segments the synthesized output so that it can be more easily analyzed and refined, e.g., by replacing voxels with higher-resolution meshes.
